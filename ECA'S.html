		<p> All of our teachers offer remediation during lunch hour, usually the second half, and after school. Students can also attend one of two homework programs, Step Up and Homework Program. A student must sign up for Step Up, but they can come to Homework Program Monday through Thursday without signing up. In both programs, teachers, CCWs and sometimes other students (volunteering) help them </p>
